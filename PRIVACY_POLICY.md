## Bot Overview

Background Pingu is a Discord bot designed for automatic parsing of Minecraft logs, primarily for the MCSR (Minecraft Speedrunning) community. It provides insights and identifies common issues within Minecraft logs. The bot processes messages in real-time and replies with the necessary insights or information. Background Pingu does not collect or store any personal information long-term.

The bot's source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/faluhub/background-pingu-v2).

## Data Collection

Background Pingu does not collect or store any personal information. The bot processes messages and replies to them in real-time but does not retain any data.

## Data Usage

Since we do not collect or store any data, there is no usage of personal information beyond real-time processing of messages.

## Data Sharing

We do not share any personal information with third parties, as we do not collect or store any data.

## Data Security

Even though we do not store data, we take reasonable measures to ensure the bot operates securely and does not expose any sensitive information. Specifically, Background Pingu scans Minecraft logs for session IDs, which can be used to access your Minecraft account, and PC usernames, which might contain personal names. If such sensitive information is detected, the bot will warn the user and censor it in any output to ensure it is not exposed.

## User Rights

As Background Pingu does not collect any data, there are no user rights related to data access, correction, or deletion. However, if you have any concerns, feel free to contact us.

## Contact Us

If you have any questions or concerns about our Privacy Policy, please contact us on Discord by sending a direct message to `maskers`.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will update it by posting the new Privacy Policy on the bot's GitHub page.
